# About

This repository contains the files for an interactive R Shiny App that takes a user-input shapefile, and returns the subset of wells from the California Online State Well Completion Report Database that fall within the bounds of the user-defined shapefile.  

The shapefile upload module in this app was adapted from the terrific work of [Matt Leonawicz](https://github.com/leonawicz/nwtapp).
